    "<p>Deutschs algortihm, also know as Deutschs-Jozsa algorithm, is devised by David Deutsch and Richard Jozsa in 1992. It is one of the earliest examples of a quantum algorithm advantage to be demonstarted.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>It specifically reveals the possibility of exponential speed-ups using quantum computers by generalizing Deutschs algorithm.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The algorithm determines between constant or balanced.It uses deutschs algorithm which is a binary function, f: {0,1}^n -> {0,1}, where n is the number of bits in the input. This function gurantees the output to be concistent of 0 for all outputs or 1 for all outputs. Otherwise it splits the outputs 50/50, half being 0, and half being 1.</p>\n",
